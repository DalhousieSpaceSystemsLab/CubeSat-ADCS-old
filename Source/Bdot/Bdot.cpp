       This derivative assumes a sample time of 1 second, field in Tesla

     INPUTS:  B - current noisy magnetic field reading from magnetometer.
              B_1 - previous field reading
     OUTPUTS: Bdot - current derivative of field

    2. The derivative is passed through a simple low-pass (IIR) filter
       The smoothing factor alpha is a hardcoded constant.
     INPUTS:  Bdot - current derivative of field.
              fBdot_1 - previous filtered derivative of field.
     OUTPUTS: fBdot - current filtered derivative of field.

    3. The magnetic moment is obtained from this filtered derivative,
        m = -K*fBdot. This is the value that drives the magnetorquer (solve m = NIS
        where I is the current needed to produce m).
        The B-dot gain K is a hardcoded constant.
     INPUTS:  fBdot - current filtered derivative of field.
     OUTPUTS: m - required current magnetic moment.
        The magnetic moment interacts with the local field to produce control
        torques for the satellite.
