 * Description: Tests the Bdot algorithm by using defined inputs identical to the ones used
 *		in the simulink model (i.e. manually found from the simulink model using scope blocks). The inputs
 *		are listed as follows:
 *		B - current noisy magnetic field reading from magnetometer.
 *		B_1 - previous (1 second time step assumption) noisy magnetic field reading from magnetometer.
 *		fBdot_1 - previous filtered derivative of field (from feedback).
 * 
 *		The current magnetic moment (m) is calculated and can be compared with the simulink model calculation.
 *		I provided the simulink model values in the code for comparison (manually found). 
 *		It is assumed the time step is 1 second and the current test time is at 2 seonds while the previous data time is 1 second.
 * 
 *		To be used with "Bdot.h" and "Bdot.cpp".
